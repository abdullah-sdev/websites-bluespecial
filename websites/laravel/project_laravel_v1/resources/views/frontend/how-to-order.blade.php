                <p>However you arrived to the AutoDataRecords website – through the blog, through our home page or as a result of searching information about VIN or vehicle history. It doesn’t matter – for your convenience we have provided a number of boxes where you can check a VIN number. This brings us to the first step.</p>

                <p>You would not be making a blind bargain. Depending on the vehicle, you will see such basic information as year of manufacture, brand, model, but also additional details – event history, mileage or information from stolen vehicle databases. Check it out yourself – all you need to do is enter a VIN number at the top of the page. Note: if no data is available at this point, no data will be included in the post-purchase report.

Here you can also decide what to purchase – we offer several types of reports. If your future car was imported, e.g. from Belgium, the Netherlands or USA, you will have an additional decision to make. You may buy a report with additional data from these countries.

                <p>If you have a discount code or a PREPAID code, enter it before selecting a payment method. Enter your e-mail address, which will also serve as your account login. You can choose from many convenient payment methods. After making a choice, follow the on-screen instructions.

Payment processing time is usually 2–3 minutes, however in case of a traditional bank transfer it may be longer, especially at the weekends and during holidays.

When your payment is successful, you will receive a payment confirmation e-mail and – if it is your first purchase – another e-mail with a password to your account. If you are a first-time buyer and you cannot find the e-mail with your password, be sure to also check the SPAM folder.</p>
